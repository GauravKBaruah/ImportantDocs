```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Install git-lfs. 

In Mac you either need *brewer* and  in terminal run : ** brew install git-lfs**.
if you have large **.RData** files, github allows you to handle such files using *git-lfs*. The steps needed to follow (that i often forget and hence this document) are below :





```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
